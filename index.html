        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> <img src="assets/images/Headshot.jpg" alt="Tina Li">
                My name is Tina and I currently work in marketing and communications at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I graduate in 2014. 
                I graduated with a dual degree in Integrative Physiology and Psychology and originally started college with the intention of going to medical school. Needless to say, that didn't happen and now here I am in a coding class learning how to make things work on the interwebs</p>
            <p>In my free time, I like to spend time with my dog, Winston, who is adorable. I also volunteer a lot with various nonprofit organizations including Heritage Camps for Adoptive Families (HCAF) and the Union of North American Vietnamese Student Associations (UNAVSA).</p>
